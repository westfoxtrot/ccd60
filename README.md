# ccd60

ccd60 is a generic 60% PCB used for Cable Car Designs keyboard designs.

It is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0. This allows you to use it for your own projects though I will not and cannot provide any support so please make sure you have that understanding before you plan to use it.

It is compatible with:

- Prophet (USB)
- Gambit (USB)
- Most tray mount boards (USB)

There are 2 BOMs: One with a USB on the board and one that uses a JST header compatible with the Unified daughterboard project.
